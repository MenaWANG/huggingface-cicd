### üõ∞Ô∏è CICD to Huggingface Hub with Github Actions

This repo utlizes `github actions` to sync changes to huggingface hub. As pull requests merged to the main branch in this repo, changes will then be synced on huggingface hub. The [Gradio App published on huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MenaWANG/english-to-latin) will then be updated automatically. üòé

## Troubleshooting notes

* ReadMe file setting for huggingface space: The huggingface space demands specific metadata in specific format at the top. This ReadMe has been revised to comply to the requirement. More on the configuration reference at https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-config-reference

* "No application file" error: The app returns this error at certain point and upon search, recreating `app.py` did fix the error (see [discussions here](Check out the configuration reference at https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-config-reference)).
